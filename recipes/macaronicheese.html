    <!-- This is the Description -->
    <h3>This is a sponsored recipe.</h3>
    <p>I was recently contacted by Borden and they challenged me to make the best macaroni and cheese that I could using their preshredded cheeses. To be quite honest, I am not a fan of preshredded cheeses. I find that they don't melt well and the oil tends to separate easily. However, recently I've been through a rut and I wanted to try something new to revitalize my cooking mood.</p>

    <p>I found that using <strong>a lot</strong> of cheese and cream was the answer to my shredded cheese problems(all from Borden of course). I was able to perfect my recipe to the point that my youngest child (also the pickiest) was able to eat 3 servings! The recipe I have created is written below.</p>

    <!-- These are the ingredients -->
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups of Borden Tripcle Cheddar Natural Shreds</li>
        <li>1 cup Borden Colby Jack Natural Shreds</li>
        <li>2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>2 tablesoons Borden bButter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Borden Vitamin D Milk</li>
        <li>1 cup Borden Half&Half</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- These are the steps -->
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
